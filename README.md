Request Mobile Site
-------------------

This is a legacy extension (non-bootstrapped) for SeaMonkey and Pale Moon that
adds a "Request Mobile Site" option to the Tools menu. When enabled, the
browser's user agent string will be changed to match Firefox for Android (but
with the SeaMonkey or PaleMoon token appended at the end). This change will
affect all browser windows.

This allows you to use sites (Instagram, for example) that expose certain
features on mobile browsers only.

This extension should also work in Firefox Developer Edition if you re-enable
legacy extensions (but this won't be the case forever.)

See the Releases section on GitHub for downloads.
